7    1. Definitions. 
8 
 
9       "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

12       "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by 
13       the copyright owner that is granting the License. 
14 
 
15       "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all 
16       other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common 
17       control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, 
18       "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the 
19       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or 
20       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the 
21       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. 
22 
 
23       "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity 
24       exercising permissions granted by this License. 
25 
 
26       "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, 
27       including but not limited to software source code, documentation 
28       source, and configuration files. 
29 
 
30       "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical 
31       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but 
32       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, 
33       and conversions to other media types. 
34 
 
35       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or 
36       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
37       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work 
38       (an example is provided in the Appendix below). 
39 
 
40       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
41       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the 
42       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications 
43       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes 
44       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
45       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, 
46       the Work and Derivative Works thereof. 
47 
 
48       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including 
49       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions 
50       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally 
51       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner 
52       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of 
53       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" 
54       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent 
55       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to 
56       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, 
57       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the 
58       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but 
59       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise 
60       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution." 
61 
 
62       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity 
63       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and 
64       subsequently incorporated within the Work. 
65 
 
66    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
67       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
68       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
69       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, 
70       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
71       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. 
72 
 
73    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
74       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
75       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
76       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, 
77       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, 
78       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable 
79       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
80       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) 
81       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You 
82       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
83       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work 
84       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct 
85       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
86       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate 
87       as of the date such litigation is filed. 
88 
 
89    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the 
90       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 
91       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You 
92       meet the following conditions: 
93 
 
94       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
95           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and 
96 
 
97       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
98           stating that You changed the files; and 
99 
 
100       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works 
101           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
102           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
103           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of 
104           the Derivative Works; and 
105 
 
106       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
107           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must 
108           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
109           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not 
110           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one 
111           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed 
112           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
113           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
114           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
115           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
116           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
117           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
118           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
119           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
120           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed 
121           as modifying the License. 
122 
 
123       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
124       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions 
125       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or 
126       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
127       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
128       the conditions stated in this License. 
129 
 
130    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 
131       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work 
132       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of 
133       this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
134       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify 
135       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed 
136       with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 
137 
 
138    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
139       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 
140       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
141       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 
142 
 
143    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or 
144       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
145       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, 
146       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or 
147       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions 
148       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
149       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
150       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any 
151       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 
152 
 
153    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
154       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, 
155       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
156       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
157       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
158       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a 
159       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
160       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
161       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
162       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor 
163       has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
164 
 
165    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing 
166       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, 
167       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, 
168       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
169       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only 
170       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf 
171       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
172       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
173       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason 
174       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. 
175
